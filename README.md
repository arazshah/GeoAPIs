# GeoAPI - Routing Module

Welcome to the **GeoAPI** repository! This project is dedicated to developing APIs related to geospatial functions. The `routing` branch focuses specifically on creating routing functionalities and providing sample implementations.

---

## Branch Overview: `routing`

This branch is dedicated to implementing routing features, such as calculating optimal paths between locations, handling different transportation modes, and integrating geospatial data for efficient navigation.

---

## Features

- **Routing Algorithms**: Implementation of shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, A*).
- **Geospatial Integration**: Utilize geospatial libraries for map-based routing.
- **Transportation Modes**: Support for routing based on walking, driving, cycling, etc.
- **Sample Project**: A starter project showcasing routing functionalities with example data and API endpoints.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed.
- **Required Libraries**:
  - Django (if developing with a web framework)
  - Geospatial libraries (e.g., `geopy`, `osmnx`, `shapely`)
  - REST API tools (e.g., `djangorestframework`, `fastapi`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository and switch to the `routing` branch:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arazshah/GeoAPI.git
   cd GeoAPI
   git checkout routing
